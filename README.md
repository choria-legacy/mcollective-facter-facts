## Deprecation Notice

This repository holds legacy code related to The Marionette Collective project.  That project has been deprecated by Puppet Inc and the code donated to the Choria Project.

## Overview

The facter plugin enables mcollective to use facter as a source for facts about your system.

Note: This method suffers from some issues due to how slow Facter can be in some cases, you should use [Facter via YAML](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/FactsFacterYAML) instead.

## Installation

* Follow the [basic plugin install guide](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/InstalingPlugins)

## Configuration

The following options can be set in server.cfg

* plugin.facter.facterlib - where to find custom facts. Defaults to /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter:/var/lib/puppet/facts

Sample configuration:

```
factsource = facter
plugin.facter.facterlib = /var/lib/puppet/lib/otherfacts
fact_cache_time = 200
```

## Usage

You should now be able to use all your facter facts in discovery and fact reporting.
